								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p><a href="https://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about-us/">London Fire Brigade</a> is London's fire and rescue service and one of the largest <br>
									firefighting and rescue organisations in the world. Being that, they are <br> 
									a very important organisation and are always very, very busy in aiding Londoners. <br>
									What's more is that information on all incidents they attend to is readily available <br>
									for whoever wants to investigate it. That's exactly what this project is about. <br>
									We are going to investigate the LFB incidents and give a broad view over the organisation's <br> 
									work. Additionally, we are going to investigate whether there is some correlation between <br>
									these incidents and other demographic information.

							<div class="image"><img src="images/basicstat-bars.png" alt="" /></div>
							<p><br>The amount of reported incidents from all groups, being either a real fire, special service requirement <br> 
								or a false alarm, varies greatly from borough to borough though.

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Housing prices and incidents</h2>
							<p>Quite interistingly, the average price for a house seems moderately correlated with the reported amount of fires.
								This makes sense, as newer more expensive buildings tend to better prepared for these types of incidents.
								On the other hand however, these more expensive houses also seem to report false alarms far more often. It therefore seems that cheaper areas might care less about AFA systems.
								All things considered, it seems that expensive neighboorhoods are generally safer than cheaper ones, at least in terms of fire incidents. 
								We do note, though, that these plots have some outliers (the most expensive boroughs) so the correlations might not be mathematically significant.

							<h2>Building periods and incidents</h2>
							<p>What's most interesting in this plot is the fire ratio. It's lowest at the beginning and end of the plot. There’s also no building period data between 1940 and 1944 - right in the middle of WW2. Maybe everything was too chaotic or the information got lost during that period? We know that older buildings are more valuable in many people's eyes - there might be precautions regarding them to ensure that nothing happens to them. Then, the highest bar is in the period right after WW2. Building funds were probably not large and houses might've been worse built after that difficult time. Lastly, there is a drop in fire incidents in houses built after 2000. It's possible that this is due to better building regulations and practices in the most recent years.</p>

							<h2>Demographics and incidents</h2>
							<p>Unsurprisingly, there is a moderate positive correlation between population density and fire incident counts. 
							   However, there is a very surprising positive correlation between fire incident counts and percentage of BAME. 
								Furthermore, there is a negative correlation between fire counts and household income. Meaning, low income households experience more fires.
								This begs the question, could there also be correlation between BAME % in a borough's population and it's average household income? It indeed shows that there is a strong negative correlation!

				<!-- Response times -->

							<h2>Fire response times</h2>
							<p>Now we're going to look into fire response times. <br>
							   Could there be any difference in how fast LFB responds to incidents based on their different demographics? <br>
							   How long does it take them to respond in each borough?
							</p>
							<div>
								<iframe class="image" id="scatter_response" height="600vw" width="700vw" src="./maps_plots/scatter_response.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
							</div>
							<p>It is clear that there is a strong correlation between the population density of each borough and the average <br> 
								response time. This does not come as a shock since it is very likely that there are more fire stations in <br>
								more densely populated areas. <br><br>
								It is very pleasing to see that there is a very weak correlation between a borough's ethnicity and median income,
								to its average response time. <br><br>
								Oddly enough, the graph shows a slight positive correlation between response time and the happiness score. 
								</p>
						</header>
						<div>
							<iframe class="image" id="redmap_response" height="600vw" width="700vw" src="./maps_plots/redmap_response.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
						</div>	
						<p>
							The plot above shows that the response time is relatively lower for boroughs situated in the center of London. <br>
							These are the areas that are generally highly populated which fits with the findings from the correlation plots <br>
							with the social profile data. <br><br>
							Although the trend differs slightly between incident categories, it seems that it is mostly the same boroughs <br> 
							that have low response time for all the three categories. Furthermore, it is mostly the same boroughs as well <br> 
							that have a high response time. This can be due to the location of the fire stations, either they generally <br> 
							arrive fast or slow.

							<h2>Incident groups</h2>
							<p>
								It is clear that both fires, special services and false alarms are reported all around London.  
							</p>

								Fires do however seem to occur more often in the north-western and south-western outskirts of London. There we have areas that tend to be less populated and contain more green areas.

							<p>As for property categories, boat related incidents tend to follow the rivers and lakes surrounding London nicely.

							<h2>False alarms: <br /> Malicius or good intent?</h2>
							Luckily, false alarms tend to be based on good intent far more often than not. There does however seem to be a slight tendency of malicius reports around Loughton, towards the top of the grid.

							<h2>Special Service Type</h2>
							<p>
							The dataset holds information regarding a wide amount of special service types.
							By investigating RTC (road traffic collision), lift releases, suicide attempts and flooding, we get this widely coloured graph.
							RTC incidents clearly occur much more frequently in the outskirts of the city around highways, whereas lift releases are more centered around areas with more dense populations.
							Flooding seems to be a problem everywhere, as does suicides.
							</p>
							<p>Note that all samples are balanced in this visualization, meaning that the proportions between each type might differ in reality. For unbalanced visualizations, see the explainer notebook.
