								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p><a href="https://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about-us/">London Fire Brigade</a> is London's fire and rescue service and one of the largest <br>
									firefighting and rescue organisations in the world. Being that, they are <br> 
									a very important organisation and are always very, very busy in aiding Londoners. <br>
									What's more is that information on all incidents they attend to is readily available <br>
									for whoever wants to investigate it. That's exactly what this project is about. <br>
									We are going to investigate the LFB incidents and give a broad view over the organisation's <br> 
									work. Additionally, we are going to investigate whether there is some correlation between <br>
									these incidents and other demographic information.

							<h2>Basic statistics of LFB</h2>
							<p>The London Fire Briagde service is extremely busy. Unfortunately, the majority of all reported incidents are false alarms.
								 <br /><br />The amount of reported incidents from all groups, being either a real fire, special service requirement or a false alarm, varies greatly from borough to borough though.
								<br /><br /> Using the interactive map below, you can see exactly which boroughs have the highest and lowest counts in the three categories. Hover over a borough to see specific information.</p>

							<h2>Housing prices and incidents</h2>
							<p>Quite interistingly, the average price for a house is well correlated with the reported amount of fires.
								This makes sense, as newer more expensive buildings tend to better prepared for these types of incidents.
								On the other hand however, these more expensive houses also report false alarms far more often. It therefore seems that cheaper areas care less about AFA systems.
								All things considered, it seems that expensive neighboorhoods are generally safer than cheaper ones, at least in terms of fire incidents. </p>

							<h2>Incident groups</h2>
							<p>
								It is clear that both fires, special services and false alarms are reported all around London.

								Fires do however seem to occur more often in the north-western and south-western outskirts of London. There areas tend to be less populated and contain more green areas.

							<h2>Property categories</h2>
							<p>As for property categories, boat related incidents tend to follow the rivers and lakes surrounding London nicely.
								Aircraft related incidents also surrounds Londons largest airports nicely.
								For all other places, road incidents non-surprisingly occur far more often.

							<h2>Special Service Type</h2>
							<p>
							The dataset holds information regarding a wide amount of special service types.
							By investigating RTC (Road traffic collision), Lift releases, Suicide attempts and flooding, we get this widely coloured graph.
							RTC incidents clearly occurs much more frequently in the outskirts of the city around highways, whereas lift releases are more centered around areas with more dense populations.
							Flooding seems to be a problem in everywhere, as does suicides.
							</p>
							<p>Note that all samples are balanced in this Visualization, meaning that the proportions between each type might differ in reality. For unbalanced Visualizations, see the explainer notebook.
